# EIP
The Ethereum Improvement Process

People wishing to submit EIPs, first should propose their idea or document as a PR. After discussion it will be published here.
We are fairly liberal with approving EIPs, and try not to be too involved in decision making on behalf of the community. The exception is in very rare cases of dispute resolution when a decision is contentious and cannot be agreed upon. In those cases, the conservative option will always be preferred.
Having a EIP here does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes Active. For a EIP to become Active requires the mutual consent of the community.
Those proposing changes should consider that ultimately consent may rest with the consensus of the Ethereum users.

# Contrubuting
First review [EIP-1](eip-1.mediawiki). Then clone the reposistory and add your EIP to it. Then submit a Pull Request to Ethereum's [EIP reposistroy](https://github.com/ethereum/EIP).
