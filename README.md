# EIP
The Ethereum Improvement Process. EIPs propose and discribe changes made to Ethereum Protocol.

People wishing to submit EIPs first should propose their idea or document as a PR. After discussion it will be published here. We are fairly liberal with approving EIPs and try not to be too involved in decision making on behalf of the community. Having a EIP here does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes Active. For a EIP to become Active requires the mutual consent of the community. Those proposing changes should consider that ultimately consent may rest with the consensus of the Ethereum users.

# Contrubuting
First review [EIP-1](eip-1.mediawiki). Then clone the reposistory and add your EIP to it. There is a template EIP here. Then submit a Pull Request to Ethereum's [EIP reposistroy](https://github.com/ethereum/EIP).
