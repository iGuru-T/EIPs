## Simple Summary

To provide native bitwise shifting with cost on par with other arithmetic operations.

## Abstract

Native bitwise shifting instructions are introduced, which are more efficient processing wise on the host and are cheaper to user by a contract.

## Motivation

EVM is lacking bitwise shifting operators, but supports other logical and arithmetic operators. Shift operations can be implemented via arithmetic operators, but that has a higher cost and requires more processing time from the host. Implementing `SHL` and `SHR` using arithmetics cost each 35 gas, while the proposed instructions take 3 gas.

## Specification

The following instructions are introduced:

### `0x1b`: `SHL` (shift left)

The `SHL` instruction (shift left) pops 2 values from the stack, `arg1` and `arg2`, and pushes on the stack the first popped value `arg1` shifted to the left by the number of bits in the second popped value `arg2`. The result is equal to

```
(arg1 * 2^arg2) mod 2^256
```

Notes:
- The shift amount (`arg2`) is interpreted as an unsigned number.
- If the shift amount (`arg2`) is greater or equal 256 the result is 0.

### `0x1c`: `SHR` (logical shift right)

The `SHR` instruction (logical shift right) pops 2 values from the stack, `arg1` and `arg2`, and pushes on the stack the first popped value `arg1` shifted to the right by the number of bits in the second popped value `arg2` with zero fill. The result is equal to

```
arg1 udiv 2^arg2
```

Notes:
- The shift amount (`arg2`) is interpreted as an unsigned number.
- If the shift amount (`arg2`) is greater or equal 256 the result is 0.

### `0x1d`: `SAR` (arithmetic shift right)

The `SAR` instruction (arithmetic shift right) pops 2 values from the stack, `arg1` and `arg2`, and pushes on the stack the first popped value `arg1` shifted to the right by the number of bits in the second popped value `arg2` with sign extension. The result is equal to

```
arg1 sdiv 2^arg2
```

Notes:
- The shift amount (`arg2`) is interpreted as an unsigned number.
- If the shift amount (`arg2`) is greater or equal 256 the result is 0 if `arg1` is non-negative or -1 if `arg1` is negative.

The cost of the shift instructions is set at `verylow` tier (3 gas).

## Rationale

Instruction operands were chosen to match the other logical and arithmetic instructions.

## Backwards Compatibility

The newly introduced instructions have no effect on bytecode created in the past.

## Test Cases

TBA
